ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation with Clustering Techniques
This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset to uncover distinct customer profiles through unsupervised learning. It includes end-to-end steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE. Multiple clustering algorithmsâ€”KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Modelsâ€”are applied to extract meaningful patterns. Visualizations via Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib highlight customer behavior across spending habits, campaign responses, and demographics. These insights support targeted marketing strategies and improved customer engagement.



Project Structure

Data Loading: Imports and preprocesses customer data from Excel.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Insights into demographics, spending habits, and campaign response.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and t-SNE applied to visualize clusters in lower dimensions.

Clustering Algorithms: KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative, and Gaussian Mixture used to segment customers.

Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette scores and visual assessments validate clustering effectiveness.

Visualization Tools: Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib used for interactive and static plots.


Results
Identified distinct customer clusters with unique socio-demographic and behavioral traits.

Insights can help tailor marketing campaigns, personalize offerings, and boost engagement.
